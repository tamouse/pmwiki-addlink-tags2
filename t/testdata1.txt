I’ve been an enthusiastic reader since childhood, and at ten years old genre lines were very simple. Nonfiction meant reading biographies, or history books, or newspaper articles; fiction meant devouring the adventures of the Hardy Boys, or Sherlock Holmes, or Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot. The latter was fun, and the former was not, and it’s no surprise that my earliest attempts at literary greatness mirrored what I enjoyed reading. I don’t remember being motivated by childhood dreams of fame and fortune. In the beginning I hoped I could get lost in my own writing as easily as that of others. Reading meant entering worlds I loved, and writing meant creating those worlds.
